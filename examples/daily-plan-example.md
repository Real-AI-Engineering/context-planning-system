## Today's Tasks

### 1. [P1] T042 - api-gateway

**Task:** Implement rate limiting middleware

**Project Context:** [api-gateway analysis](../projects/api-gateway.md)

**File:** `projects/company/api-gateway/specs/003-rate-limiting/tasks.md`

**Scope:** Security → Rate Limiting → Implementation

**Project Overview:**
- **Type:** REST API Gateway with authentication and routing
- **Tech Stack:** Python 3.11+, FastAPI, Redis, PostgreSQL
- **Key Features:** JWT authentication, request routing, rate limiting, logging
- **CLI Commands:** `/api.start`, `/api.test`, `/api.migrate`, `/api.deploy`
- **Current State:** 12 open tasks, 85% test coverage, production-ready

**Risks & Considerations:**
- Redis dependency required for rate limiting (check if running)
- Need to handle distributed rate limiting (multiple API instances)
- Consider impact on existing clients (gradual rollout?)
- Test edge cases: burst traffic, clock skew, Redis failures

**TODO Before Starting:**
- [ ] Review existing middleware in `src/middleware/`
- [ ] Check Redis connection configuration
- [ ] Read rate limiting algorithm docs (token bucket vs sliding window)
- [ ] Verify test coverage for middleware layer

**Notes:** High priority - blocking security audit completion

- [ ] Completed

### 2. [P1] T101 - data-pipeline

**Task:** Add error handling for failed S3 uploads

**Project Context:** [data-pipeline analysis](../projects/data-pipeline.md)

**File:** `projects/company/data-pipeline/specs/002-error-handling/tasks.md`

**Scope:** Reliability → Error Handling → S3 Integration

**Project Overview:**
- **Type:** ETL data pipeline for analytics
- **Tech Stack:** Python 3.11+, Apache Airflow, AWS S3, Pandas
- **Key Features:** Daily ETL jobs, data validation, S3 storage, alerting
- **CLI Commands:** `/pipeline.run`, `/pipeline.test`, `/pipeline.validate`
- **Current State:** 8 open tasks, 60% test coverage, needs improvement

**Risks & Considerations:**
- **Low test coverage (60%)** - add tests for new error handling code
- AWS credentials required (check `.env` configuration)
- Need retry logic with exponential backoff
- Consider partial upload handling (multipart uploads)
- Alert on persistent failures (integration with monitoring)

**TODO Before Starting:**
- [ ] Review existing S3 client code in `src/storage/s3.py`
- [ ] Check AWS error codes for retryable vs non-retryable errors
- [ ] Verify IAM permissions for S3 operations
- [ ] Add test cases for network failures and S3 errors

**Notes:** Critical for production stability - affects daily ETL jobs

- [ ] Completed

### 3. [P2] T015 - dashboard

**Task:** Add responsive design for mobile devices

**Project Context:** [dashboard analysis](../projects/dashboard.md)

**File:** `projects/company/dashboard/specs/004-mobile-support/tasks.md`

**Scope:** UI/UX → Mobile Responsiveness → Layout

**Project Overview:**
- **Type:** Analytics dashboard web application
- **Tech Stack:** JavaScript (React), TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Vite
- **Key Features:** Data visualization, real-time updates, user preferences
- **CLI Commands:** `/dash.dev`, `/dash.build`, `/dash.test`, `/dash.deploy`
- **Current State:** 15 open tasks, 75% test coverage, active development

**Risks & Considerations:**
- Need to test on multiple device sizes (phone, tablet, desktop)
- Consider performance on mobile networks (optimize bundle size)
- Touch interactions different from mouse (gestures, tap targets)
- Existing charts may not render well on small screens

**TODO Before Starting:**
- [ ] Review current CSS framework usage (Tailwind responsive utilities)
- [ ] Check existing components for responsive patterns
- [ ] Set up mobile browser testing (Chrome DevTools, BrowserStack)
- [ ] Plan breakpoints: mobile (<640px), tablet (640-1024px), desktop (>1024px)

**Notes:** Nice-to-have for this sprint - can move to next week if needed

- [ ] Completed

### 4. [P2] T067 - api-gateway

**Task:** Add OpenAPI documentation generation

**Project Context:** [api-gateway analysis](../projects/api-gateway.md)

**File:** `projects/company/api-gateway/specs/005-documentation/tasks.md`

**Scope:** Documentation → API Docs → OpenAPI

**Project Overview:**
- **Type:** REST API Gateway with authentication and routing
- **Tech Stack:** Python 3.11+, FastAPI, Redis, PostgreSQL
- **Key Features:** JWT authentication, request routing, rate limiting, logging
- **CLI Commands:** `/api.start`, `/api.test`, `/api.migrate`, `/api.deploy`
- **Current State:** 12 open tasks, 85% test coverage, production-ready

**Risks & Considerations:**
- FastAPI has built-in OpenAPI support (should be straightforward)
- Need to add detailed descriptions to all endpoints
- Consider authentication flow documentation (OAuth2, JWT)
- Test examples should be production-ready (no test secrets)

**TODO Before Starting:**
- [ ] Check existing FastAPI route decorators for docstrings
- [ ] Review OpenAPI best practices (tags, descriptions, examples)
- [ ] Set up Swagger UI for interactive docs
- [ ] Verify security schemes are documented correctly

**Notes:** Helps with API client development and testing

- [ ] Completed

### 5. [P3] T008 - monitoring

**Task:** Set up Grafana dashboards for system metrics

**Project Context:** [monitoring analysis](../projects/monitoring.md)

**File:** `projects/company/monitoring/specs/001-dashboards/tasks.md`

**Scope:** Observability → Dashboards → System Metrics

**Project Overview:**
- **Type:** Monitoring and observability infrastructure
- **Tech Stack:** Prometheus, Grafana, Loki, Python
- **Key Features:** Metrics collection, log aggregation, alerting
- **CLI Commands:** `/mon.start`, `/mon.query`, `/mon.alert`
- **Current State:** 5 open tasks, new project, needs setup

**Risks & Considerations:**
- **New project** - need to set up infrastructure first
- Prometheus must be collecting metrics (verify scrape configs)
- Grafana needs data source configuration
- Consider dashboard organization (by service, by team, by SLO)
- Use dashboard-as-code approach (JSON/YAML in git)

**TODO Before Starting:**
- [ ] Verify Prometheus is running and collecting metrics
- [ ] Check Grafana is accessible (http://localhost:3000)
- [ ] Review existing metrics exported by services
- [ ] Plan dashboard layout: system overview, service details, SLOs
- [ ] Consider using Grafana provisioning for version control

**Notes:** Low priority - nice to have but not blocking

- [ ] Completed
